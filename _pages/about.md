I am currently working as a senior software engineer at NCAR/CGD. I have a background in Meteorological Engineering, Atmosphere Ocean Sciences and Computational Science and Engineering and have numerous publication in those fields and teaching experience. My main areas of interest are computational simulation of Earth system components, air-sea interaction, hydrodynamics of lakes, scientific visualization with in situ techniques (incl. co-processing), process automation with scientific workflow systems, climate science and dynamical downscalling. I am also interested in the design and development of fully coupled regional and global Earth system models
and curently working on various projects in model development field such as Unified Forecast System (UFS), UFS Weather Model and UFS Coastal.
